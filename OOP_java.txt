		--------java source file--------
In java, we can create any no of classes but atmost one public class can be created in single file. 
If you are not using public modifier with these, the you can use any name to save this file. If you 
are using public modifier with any class, then this file can be saved with that class name only.

In java, you can create multiple classes and all those classes can contian "main" method. If there is 
no public modifier with any class, and multiple main methods are present in multiple classes, then you 
can save the file with any name. After executing program, a compiled file will be created for each class.
You can execute any one of these file by writing "java className". If we are executing a particular class 
after compilation, and that class contains main method, that class main method will be executed. 
If we are executing class without main method, we will get compile time error.

If there is main method and public class then main method should be in that public class.

// chk kro, 1 public class lo or 1 without public or 2no m main method lko, kia error ata h k ni

You can compile java file using "javac filename.java".

// Why we need to place each class in separate class?
It is how it has been designed and I am not sure if the reason is documented. But here is a good reason on 
why it is done that way. Let's assume we have two public classes Y & Z in a file named Y.java. Now, let's 
assume a different class X is using Z. Now, when we compile X, the compiler first tries to locate Z.class 
and if it cannot find it, then it tries to locate Z.java so that it can compile it automatically. But, since 
we only have Y.java, the class Z cannot be located and hence we get a compilation error. So, we do need to 
place them in separate files.

-------------------------------------------------------------
If you are using external libraries, you must import it or you can use fully qualified names.
  
1) Fully qualified names make our code hard to read ( If we need multiple references in our code, we have 
to type full path each time, boilerplate code). 
java.util.AL l = new java.util.AL();
